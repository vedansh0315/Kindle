        Premise
        Fabienne is one of the great stars of French cinema. She reigns amongst men who love and admire her. However, she has a problematic relationship with her daughter Lumir, a screenwriter. When Lumir and her husband return to Paris with their young child, things come to a head with the publication of Fabienne’s memoir: the reunion between mother and daughter quickly turns confrontational as truths are told, accounts are settled and love and resentment are confessed.[2]
