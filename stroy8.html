        The Invisible Man (2020 film)<br>
        The Invisible Man is a 2020 science fiction psychological horror film written and directed by Leigh Whannell. It follows a woman who believes she is being stalked by her abusive and wealthy boyfriend even after his apparent suicide.[4] She ultimately deduces that he has acquired the ability to become invisible.[5] The film stars Elisabeth Moss, Aldis Hodge, Storm Reid, Harriet Dyer, Michael Dorman, and Oliver Jackson-Cohen. It is an international co-production of the United States and Australia.

The development of a new film based on H. G. Wells's 1897 book began as early as 2006. The project was revived as part of Universal's shared cinematic universe in 2016, intended to consist of their classic monsters, with Johnny Depp attached to star in the title role. After The Mummy was released in 2017 to critical and financial failure, development was halted on all projects. In early 2019, the studio changed their plans from a serialized universe to films based on individualized story-telling and the project reentered development. Principal photography lasted from July to September 2019 in Sydney, Australia.

The Invisible Man was released in the United States on February 28, 2020, by Universal Pictures. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Moss' performance, its inventive modernization of the novel's plot, and the combination of scares with "a smart narrative about how people can be manipulated and abused in harmful relationships".[6] The film grossed $129 million worldwide against a $7 million budget and is currently the fifth highest-grossing film of 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic closing theaters across the world, Universal announced the film would be made available for digital rental just four weeks after it was released theatrically.
Plot
Trapped in a violent, controlling relationship with wealthy optics engineer and businessman Adrian Griffin, Cecilia Kass one night drugs him with diazepam and escapes their home with help from her sister Emily.

Cecilia hides out with childhood friend Detective James Lanier and his teenage daughter Sydney. Adrian seemingly commits suicide and leaves Cecilia $5 million in his will, handled by his lawyer brother Tom. Cecilia suspects another presence in the house after several strange events and calls for James but he assures her she is just traumatized. During a job interview, she faints after finding her work portfolio's contents removed. The doctor says they found high levels of diazepam in her system. She finds the same bottle she drugged Adrian with, which she dropped during her escape, in her bathroom.

Cecilia arranges a meeting with Tom and James, insisting that Adrian faked his death and used his optics expertise to become invisible in order to torment her, but gets rebuffed. Sydney is hit by an unseen force, leading her and James to assume Cecilia did it. She tries a number of tactics to catch the figure. After finding Adrian's old phone and covering the figure with paint, she ends up in a violent struggle before escaping to Adrian's home to investigate. In his lab, she finds a suit that confirms her suspicions. The invisible figure attacks again so she flees and contacts Emily. The pair meet in a restaurant but the invisible figure slits Emily's throat and places the knife in Cecilia's hand, framing her for the crime.

Remanded to a mental hospital while she awaits trial, a staffer informs Cecilia that she is pregnant. Tom offers to get her charges dropped if she agrees to "return to him" and raise the child, implying that he helped his brother stage his suicide while revealing Adrian tampered with her birth control to ensure she became pregnant. Cecilia refuses and steals a pen from his briefcase. That night, she uses the pen to pretend to commit suicide to draw the invisible figure out. When the figure tries to stop her, she stabs him repeatedly, causing the suit to malfunction. The security team arrives but the figure incapacitates them before fleeing the hospital with Cecilia in pursuit. Promising not to harm her because of her pregnancy, the figure instead threatens to attack those she loves.

Cecilia races to James' house, where she finds the figure attacking him and Sydney. She manages to shoot him but when she unmasks him, it is Tom in the suit. Police find a captive Adrian alive at his house, tied up and claiming Tom held him prisoner. Cecilia disputes this, insisting the brothers must have shared the suit, with Adrian sending Tom to the house knowing what would happen.

In an attempt to get Adrian to confess, she meets him at his house while James listens on a wire. She agrees to mend their relationship but only if he confesses to being the figure. Adrian insists Tom did kidnap him, claiming the experience changed his outlook on life and how he treated her. When she cries, Adrian alludes to his abuse, using similar phrasing to that of the figure. Smiling, Cecilia departs to use the restroom. Moments later, the security camera captures Adrian seemingly committing suicide. Cecilia returns and apparently distraught, calls the police. Out of the camera's sight however, she taunts Adrian after retrieving the spare suit she used to kill him.

When James arrives, she confirms what the camera saw. He spots the suit in her bag but allows her to leave. Relieved that she's finally free of Adrian, Cecilia leaves with the suit.

Production
Development of a new The Invisible Man film began as early as 2006 when David S. Goyer was hired to write the screenplay.[7] Goyer remained attached to the project as late as 2011, with little to no further development on the film.[8]

In February 2016, the project was revived with Johnny Depp cast as the titular character and Ed Solomon writing the screenplay.[9] It was revealed to be part of an intended cinematic universe featuring Universal Pictures' modern-day reboot of their classic monsters. The would-be film series was set to begin in 2017 with The Mummy, starring Tom Cruise, Sofia Boutella, and Russell Crowe, followed by a remake of The Bride of Frankenstein in 2019. An image released in May 2017 of Depp with Cruise, Boutella, Crowe, and Javier Bardem, who was cast to play Frankenstein's monster, announced this shared world as the Dark Universe. The Mummy director Alex Kurtzman stated that fans should expect at least one film per year from the series.[10] However, once The Mummy was released to negative critical reception and box office returns deemed by the studio as insufficient, changes were made to the Dark Universe to focus on individual storytelling and move away from the shared universe concept.[11]

In January 2019, Universal announced that all future movies on their horror characters would focus on standalone stories, avoiding inter-connectivity.[12] Successful horror film producer Jason Blum, founder of production company Blumhouse Productions,[13] had at various times publicly expressed his interest in reviving and working on future installments within the Dark Universe films. The Invisible Man was set to be written and directed by Leigh Whannell, and produced by Blum, but would not star Depp as previously reported.[14] In March 2019, Elisabeth Moss entered early negotiations to star,[15] with her official casting the following month.[16] Storm Reid, Aldis Hodge, and Harriet Dyer later joined the cast,[17] with Oliver Jackson-Cohen set to play the titular role in July.[18]

Principal photography began on July 16, 2019 and ended on September 17, 2019 in Sydney, Australia.[19]

On February 22, 2020, during an interview with Cinemablend's ReelBlend Podcast, Whannell stated that the film was never planned to be part of any cinematic universe, including the Dark Universe.[20] He stated,
"It was weird, this film came about in a really random way. It wasn't like I was plugged into some kind of worldbuilding. I had just finished Upgrade, they called me in for a meeting with some of these Universal and Blumhouse execsâ€¦ I go to this meeting, and they didn't really talk about Upgrade. I mean, they said they liked it and they moved on. So, I'm sitting on this couch thinking, 'What am I here for? What is this meeting about?' And they started talking about The Invisible Man."[20]

Music
Benjamin Wallfisch composed the music for the film.[21] Back Lot Music has released the soundtrack.

Release
The Invisible Man was theatrically released in the United States on February 28, 2020 by Universal Pictures.[22] It was originally scheduled for release on March 13, 2020, but in August 2019 was moved up two weeks.[23]

On March 16, 2020 Universal Pictures announced that the film would be released digitally in the United States and Canada through Premium VOD on March 20, just three weeks after the film's theatrical debut and before the end of the usual 90-day theatrical run.[24] This was because of movie theaters closures that started in mid March because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Other films distributed by the studio, such as The Hunt and Trolls World Tour, were also released earlier than expected for the same reason.[25][26]

As pandemic restrictions were loosened, the film was released in three Santikos Theatres locations in San Antonio, Texas on May 1, 2020.[27][28]

Reception
Box office
As of June 14, 2020, The Invisible Man has grossed $67.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $62.6 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $129.4 million.[2][3]

In the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross $24â€“30 million from 3,610 theaters in its opening weekend.[6] It made $9.8 million on its first day, including $1.65 million from Thursday night previews. The film went on to debut to $28.9 million, topping the box office.[29] The film made $15.1 million in its second weekend (dropping 46%) and then $5.9 million in its third weekend.[30] In the film's fourth weekend, due to the mass theater closures around the country caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it made $64,000 from 111 locations, mostly drive-in theaters.[31]

The film continued to play almost exclusively at drive-ins in the following weeks; it made $444,000 in its 13th weekend, $320,800 in its 14th, and $209,000 in its 15th.[32][33] The film reclaimed the top spot atop the box office in its 16th weekend, making $383,000 from 187 theaters.[3]

Critical response
As of June 2020, the film holds a 91% approval rating of review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 360 reviews with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "Smart, well-acted, and above all scary, The Invisible Man proves that sometimes, the classic source material for a fresh reboot can be hiding in plain sight."[34] Metacritic calculated a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 based on 58 critic reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews."[35] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, and PostTrak reported it received an overall positive score of 76% and an average four out of five stars, with 53% of people they polled saying they would definitely recommend the film.[29]

Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that Moss's performance "gives the movie its emotional stakes," adding, "while her agony can be unnerving, it is even more shivery when her weeping stops and this horror-movie damsel in distress becomes a threat."[36] Writing for The A.V. Club, Jesse Hassenger gave the film a "B+", also praising Moss's performance and the film's centering of her character's experience;[37] the publication followed up with a video review from senior writer Katie Rife and Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, who also gave a positive review, for the aesthetic and filmmaking of Blumhouse Productions and Moss's performance.[38] Alison Willmore of Vulture commented about the effectiveness of Moss's facial expressions, and said that she "has established herself as an empress of the onscreen breakdown, our lady of ruined eye makeup".[39] Patrick Cavanaugh of ComicBook.com gave the film four out of five stars, and wrote that Whannell's film is "an experience that is both effective as a full-blown horror film and as a chilling reminder of the abuse one can suffer from a supposed loved one."[40]

Conversely, Nicholas Barber from BBC gave the film two out of five stars, opining that "the latest remake of the HG Wells tale offers a timely feminist spin â€“ but it's lacking in thrills." He criticized the film's vagueness, concluding, "at a time when small-scale horror movies can be as stunning as A Quiet Place and Get Out, a film as perfunctory as The
