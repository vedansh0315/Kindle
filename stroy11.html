        <p>The call of the Wilds.

        </p>
        <p>The Call of the Wild is a short adventure novel by Jack London, published in 1903 and set in Yukon, Canada, during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush, when strong sled dogs were in high demand. The central character of the novel is a dog named Buck. The story opens at a ranch in Santa Clara Valley, California, when Buck is stolen from his home and sold into service as a sled dog in Alaska. He becomes progressively feral in the harsh environment, where he is forced to fight to survive and dominate other dogs. By the end, he sheds the veneer of civilization, and relies on primordial instinct and learned experience to emerge as a leader in the wild.

            London spent almost a year in the Yukon, and his observations form much of the material for the book. The story was serialized in The Saturday Evening Post in the summer of 1903 and was published later that year in book form. The book's great popularity and success made a reputation for London. As early as 1923, the story was adapted to film, and it has since seen several more cinematic adaptations.
            Plot summary
            The story opens in 1897 with Buck, a powerful 140-pound St. Bernard–Scotch Collie mix,[1][2] happily living in California's Santa Clara Valley as the pampered pet of Judge Miller and his family. One night, assistant gardener Manuel, needing money to pay off gambling debts, steals Buck and sells him to a stranger. Buck is shipped to Seattle where he is confined in a crate, starved, and ill-treated. When released, Buck attacks his handler, the "man in the red sweater," who teaches Buck the "law of the club and fang," sufficiently cowing him. The man shows some kindness after Buck demonstrates obedience.
            
            Shortly after, Buck is sold to two French-Canadian dispatchers from the Canadian government, François and Perrault, who take him to Alaska. Buck is trained as a sled dog for the Klondike region of Canada. In addition to Buck, Francois and Perrault add an additional ten dogs to their team (Spitz, Dave, Dolly, Pike, Dub, Billie, Joe, Sol-leks, Teek, and Koona). Buck's teammates teach him how to survive cold winter nights and about pack society. Over the next several weeks on the trail, a bitter rivalry develops between Buck and the lead dog, Spitz, a vicious and quarrelsome white husky. Buck eventually kills Spitz in a fight and becomes the lead dog.
            
            When François and Perrault complete the round-trip of the Yukon Trail in record time, returning to Skagway with their dispatches, they are given new orders from the Canadian government. They sell their sled team to a "Scotch half-breed" man, who works in the mail service. The dogs must make long, tiring trips, carrying heavy loads to the mining areas. While running the trail, Buck seems to have memories of a canine ancestor who has a short-legged "hairy man" companion. Meanwhile, the weary animals become weak from the hard labor, and the wheel dog, Dave, a morose husky, becomes terminally sick and is eventually shot.
            
            With the dogs too exhausted and foot-sore to be of use, the mail-carrier sells them to three stampeders from the American Southland (present-day contiguous United States)—a vain woman named Mercedes, her sheepish husband Charles, and her arrogant brother Hal. They lack survival skills for the Northern wilderness, struggle to control the sled, and ignore others' helpful advice—particularly warnings about the dangerous spring melt. When told her sled is too heavy, Mercedes dumps out crucial supplies in favor of fashion objects. She and Hal foolishly create a team of 14 dogs, believing they will travel faster. The dogs are overfed and overworked, then are starved when food runs low. Most of the dogs die on the trail, leaving only Buck and four other dogs when they pull into the White River.
            
            The group meets John Thornton, an experienced outdoorsman, who notices the dogs' poor, weakened condition. The trio ignores Thornton's warnings about crossing the ice and press onward. Exhausted, starving, and sensing danger ahead, Buck refuses to continue. After Hal beats Buck, a disgusted Thornton hits him and cuts Buck free. The group presses onward with the four remaining dogs, but their weight causes the ice to break and the dogs and humans (along with their sled) fall into the river and drown.
            
            As Thornton nurses Buck back to health, Buck grows to love him. Buck saves Thornton when he falls into a river. After Thornton takes him on trips to pan for gold, a bonanza king (someone who struck it rich in the gold fields) named Mr. Matthewson wagers Thornton on Buck's strength and devotion. Buck pulls a sled with a half-ton (1,000-pound (450 kg)) load of flour, breaking it free from the frozen ground, dragging it 100 yards (91 m) and winning Thornton US$1,600 in gold dust. A "king of the Skookum Benches" offers a large sum to buy Buck, but Thornton declines.
            
            Using his winnings, Thornton pays his debts but elects to continue searching for gold with friends Pete and Hans, sledding Buck and six other dogs to search for a fabled Lost Cabin. Once they locate a suitable gold find, the dogs find they have nothing to do. Buck has more ancestor-memories of being with the primitive "hairy man."[3] While Thornton and his two friends pan gold, Buck hears the call of the wild, explores the wilderness, and socializes with a Northwestern wolf from a local pack. However, Buck does not join the wolves and returns to Thornton. Buck repeatedly goes back and forth between Thornton and the wild, unsure of where he belongs. Returning to the campsite one day, he finds Hans, Pete, and Thornton have been murdered by Native-American Yeehats. Enraged, Buck kills several natives to avenge Thornton, then realizes he no longer has any human ties. He goes looking for his wild brother and encounters a hostile wolf pack. He fights them and wins, then discovers that the lone wolf he had socialized with is a pack member. Buck follows the pack into the forest and answers the call of the wild.
            
            The legend of Buck spreads among other Native Americans as the "Ghost Dog" of the Northland (Alaska and northwestern Canada). Each year, on the anniversary of his attack on the Yeehats, Buck returns to the former campsite where he was last with Thornton, Hans, and Pete, to mourn their deaths. Every winter, leading the wolf-pack, Buck wreaks vengeance on the Yeehats, "as he sings a song of the younger world, which is the song of the pack."
            
            Main characters
            Major dog characters:
            
            Buck, the novel's protagonist; a 140-pound St. Bernard–Scotch Collie mix who lived contentedly in California with Judge Miller. However, he was stolen and sold to the Klondike by the gardener's assistant Manuel and was forced to work as a sled dog in the harsh Yukon. He eventually finds a loving master named John Thornton and gradually grows feral as he adapts to the wilderness, eventually joining a wolf pack. After Thornton's death, he is free of humans and becomes a legend in the Klondike.
            Spitz the novel's main antagonist and Buck's arch-rival; a white-haired husky from Spitsbergen who had accompanied a geological survey into the Canadian Barrens. He has a long career as a sled-dog leader, and sees Buck's uncharacteristic ability, for a South-land dog, to adapt and thrive in the North as a threat to his dominance. He repeatedly provokes fights with Buck, who bides his time.
            Dave the 'wheel dog' at the back end of the dog-team. He is brought North with Buck and Spitz and is a faithful sled-dog who only wants to be left alone and led by an effective lead-dog. During his second down-trek on the Yukon Trail, he grows mortally weak, but the men accommodate his pride by allowing him to continue to drive the sled until he becomes so weak that he is euthanized.
            Curly, a large Newfoundland dog who was murdered and eaten by native huskies.
            Billee, a good-natured, appeasing husky who faithfully pulls the sled until being worked to death by Hal, Charles, and Mercedes.
            Dolly, a strong husky purchased in Dyea, Alaska by Francois and Perrault. Dolly is badly hurt after an attack of wild dogs, and she later goes rabid herself, furiously attacking the other sled dogs including Buck, until her skull is forever smashed by Francois, as he struggles to stop her madness.
            Joe, Billee's brother, but with an opposite personality— sour and introspective. Spitz is unable to discipline him, but Buck, after rising to the head of the team, brings him into line.
            Sol-leks ('The Angry One'), a one-eyed husky who doesn't like being approached from his blind side. Like Dave, he expects nothing, gives nothing, and only cares about being left alone and having an effective leader.
            Pike, a clever malingerer and thief; Dub - an awkward blunderer ... always getting caught; Teek and Koona —additional huskies on the Yukon-Trail dog-team.
            Skeet and Nig —two South-land dogs owned by John Thornton when he acquires Buck.
            The Wild Brother, a lone wolf who befriends Buck.
            Major human characters:
            
            Judge Miller, Buck's first master who lived in Santa Clara Valley, California with his family. Unlike Thornton, he only expressed friendship with Buck, whereas Thornton expressed love.
            Manuel, Judge Miller's employee who sells Buck to the Klondike to pay off his gambling debt.
            The Man in the Red Sweater, a trainer who beats Buck to teach him the law of the club.
            Perrault, a French-Canadian courier for the Canadian government who is Buck's first Northland master.
            François, a French-Canadian mixed race man and Perrault's partner, the musher who drives the sled dogs.
            Hal, an aggressive and violent musher who is Mercedes' brother and Charles' brother-in-law; he is inexperienced handling sled dogs.
            Charles, Mercedes' husband, who is less violent than Hal.
            Mercedes, a spoiled and pampered woman who is Hal's sister and Charles' wife.
            John Thornton, a gold hunter who is Buck's final master until he is killed by the Yeehats.
            Pete and Hans —John Thornton's two partners as he pans for gold in the East.
            The Yeehats, a tribe of Native Americans. After they kill John Thornton, Buck attacks them, and eternally 'dogs' them after going wild—assuring they never re-enter the valley where his last master was murdered.</p>
